abstract="A geometrical interpretation of the classical tests of the relation between two sets of variables is presented. One of the variable sets may be considered as fixed and then we have a multivariate regression model. When the Wilks' lambda distribution is viewed geometrically it is obvious that the two special cases, theF distribution and the HotellingT                2 distribution are equivalent. From the geometrical perspective it is also obvious that the test statistic and thep-value are unchanged if the responses and the predictors are interchanged.",

 abstract = {This article draws together some common geometrical ideas and their statistical and probabilistic analogs and outlines them for teaching elementary statistical ideas to students inside and outside the mathematical sciences. The main benefit from this approach is an appreciation of the surprising power of a small number of underlying principles. The approach emphasizes the equivalence of the notions, expressed in different "languages," rather than any one expression by itself.},

	abstract = {By describing the geometric analogues of the concepts from various perspectives, this work aims to provide a richer and intuitive comprehension of the concept of partial correlation coefficient in the regression analysis, especially for beginning students. Based on a simple and strictly correct geometric framework, this article geometrically illustrates the concept of partial correlation coefficient in regression analysis from the views of the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell Theorem, partial F test statistics, and the comparisons with other levels of correlation coefficients. In our opinion, the geometric approach sheds lights on the regression analysis as it provides a richer and more concrete understanding for readers, especially for beginners.  This paper can also be served as a supplementary reading material for serious beginners.},
